  <h2>Intelligent Automation Within the Browser</h2>
  <p><em>Open-source browser automation powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro-exp</em></p>
</div>

## Overview

Navigator AI empowers users and developers to seamlessly automate tasks within web browsers (with app support coming in the future). Unlike traditional browser automation tools, Navigator AI offers:

- A **component library** for direct integration into web applications
- A **browser extension** for end-user automation

Consider it as Cursor/Windsurf for websites and applications. Big shoutout to [Browser-Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) as Navigator AI is inspired by them and currently is a kind of an Chrome extension version that does what they do inside but inside your browser.

## Key Features

- **Direct Web Integration**: Embeddable React/framework components allow developers to add browser automation capabilities directly within their web/mobile applications. Users can easily use voice/text to automatically execute workflows on your app.

- **User-Friendly Extension**: A browser extension that allows users to create, manage, and run repeatable workflows directly in their browser.

- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Add custom rules, documentation, and knowledge bases that the agent will prioritize over its LLM-based workflow, making the agent specific to YOUR application.

- **Self-Improvement**: The agent improves over time based on how users interact with pages, even when not actively using the agent.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:

  - React, Vite, TypeScript (for both component library and extension)
  - Packaged in a Turborepo for efficient management

- **Backend**:

  - Python, FastAPI

- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL (primary data storage)
  - Redis (caching)
  - Weaviate (vector database, deployed via Docker)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) - [Install Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Package manager:
  - pnpm - [Install Guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) (`npm install -g pnpm`)
  - OR npm (comes with Node.js)
- Python 3.9+ - [Install Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Poetry (Python dependency management) - [Install Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database services) - [Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A Gemini API key, that you can create here : https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SohamRatnaparkhi/navigator-ai.git
   cd navigator-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   cd apps/server
   poetry install

   # Install Node dependencies
   cd apps/extension
   pnpm install
   # OR
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add Gemini API key**

   ```bash
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" > /apps/server/.env
   ```

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:server
   # OR
   npm run dev:server
   ```

5. **Run Redis**

   ```bash
   cd apps/server
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **Build and install the extension**

   ```bash
   # Build the extension
   pnpm run build
   # OR
   npm run build
   ```

   Then:

   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `/apps/extension/dist` directory
   - The extension should now appear in your browser toolbar
